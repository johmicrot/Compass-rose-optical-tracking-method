# Compass-rose-optical-tracking-method

I stumbled upon the paper titled "Compass Rose: A Rotational Robust
Signature for
Optical Flow Computation".

It looked interesting to me so I tried to implement it.  Due to time
constraints I wasn't able to complete the pyramidal coarse-to-fine flow
refinement strategy, so my approach is highly susceptible to large
displacements.

Research paper attached.
